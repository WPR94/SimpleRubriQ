# Safeguarding & Student Safety Policy

## Overview
Simple Rubriq is committed to the safety and well-being of students. While our primary function is academic assessment, we recognize our responsibility in the digital classroom ecosystem. This document outlines our safeguarding measures, designed for UK and international schools.

## 🛡️ AI Safeguarding Protocols
Our AI models are instructed to adhere to strict safeguarding protocols:

1.  **Content Detection**: The AI is prompted to detect explicit mentions of:
    *   Self-harm or suicide
    *   Physical, emotional, or sexual abuse
    *   Radicalization or extremism
    *   Severe violence
2.  **Teacher Alerts**: If such content is detected in a student's essay, the AI will generate a **"⚠️ SAFEGUARDING ALERT"** at the top of the feedback. This prompts the teacher to review the work immediately and follow their school's specific safeguarding procedures (e.g., contacting the Designated Safeguarding Lead).
3.  **Neutrality**: In these cases, the AI maintains a neutral, professional tone to avoid escalating the situation or providing inappropriate advice.

## 🔒 Data Security & Privacy
*   **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).
*   **Access Control**: Strict Row Level Security (RLS) ensures teachers can only access data for their own students.
*   **Data Minimization**: We only collect data necessary for the grading function.
*   **GDPR Compliance**: Fully compliant with UK GDPR. See `UK_GDPR_COMPLIANCE.md` for details.

## 👩‍🏫 Teacher Responsibility
Simple Rubriq is an assistive tool, not a replacement for human judgment.
*   **Review Required**: Teachers must review all AI-generated feedback before releasing it to students.
*   **Final Decision**: The teacher remains the final arbiter of grades and feedback.
*   **Duty of Care**: Teachers retain their statutory duty of care towards their students.

## 🇬🇧 UK Context (KCSIE)
Our policies align with the "Keeping Children Safe in Education" (KCSIE) statutory guidance, specifically regarding the use of educational technology and online safety.
